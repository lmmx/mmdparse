# mmdparse
Parse the .mmd file format (a 'modified markdown' I came up with for note taking at university)

- uses bootstrapping of sorts (?) by first reading in a strictly defined `.mmt` file ['modified markdown table'] which outlines the symbols in use, which will then be used to create an AST for an `.mmd` in general usage [i.e. must be specified robustly]
- work in progress!
